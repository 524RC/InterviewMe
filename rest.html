        <p class="aboutText">Hi! We are three high school seniors who enjoy interviewing and hearing people's stories. Our objective is primarily to create more openness in society to allow people to share things they typically wouldn't with a stranger in hopes of breaking down social barriers that strangers subconsciously create toward one another. We aim to share their stories authentically, focusing on their passions, challenges, contributions, and enlightening experiences. Join us in our move toward a more interconnected society!

                                Hi! My name is Paolo and I’m one of the founders, directors, and personalities behind
                                IntroduceMe. I am also the executive producer of the Teen Ventures magazine and president
                                of my school’s Asian Heritage Club, Chess Club, and DECA chapter. Growing up, I have
                                always been fascinated by stories of history and current events, this interest developing
                                into a deep love of every facet of our world and its diverse peoples, cultures,
                                countries, and politics. As a Global Studies student at Freehold Township HS, with this
                                project, I hope to share my passion for international service and inspire greater
                                community involvement in addressing modern issues.

                                Hello all! I'm Sawyer Chang, co-founder, editor, and interviewer at IntroduceMe. While I
                                love the art of talking to strangers and discovering untold stories, I also volunteer my
                                time in other capacities. These include captain of my school's Mock Trial and tennis
                                team, president of our DECA chapter, and president of our Rhizome voter-advocacy club at
                                Colts Neck High School's Law and Public Service Program. Through IntroduceMe, I aim to
                                cultivate not only my speaking skills and amiableness but also widen my view of how
                                everyone comes from a different background and has a unique story to tell.
