                Hi! We are three high school seniors who enjoy interviewing and hearing people's stories. Our objective is primarily to create more openness in society to allow people to share things they typically wouldn't with a stranger in hopes of breaking down social barriers that strangers subconsciously create toward one another. We aim to share their stories authentically, focusing on their passions, challenges, contributions, and enlightening experiences. Join us in our move toward a more interconnected society!
